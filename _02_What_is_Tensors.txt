>> What are Tensors:
    Tensor is a multi-dimensional array of numerical values. It is a fundamental data structure in deep learning and is used to represent data in a way that can be processed by neural networks.

    Ex:
        Tensor of 0 dimension: scalar
        Tensor of 1 dimension: vector
        Tensor of 2 dimensions: matrix
        Tensor of 3 dimensions: 3D array
